# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

if you close your vscode or terminal then you need to re-deploy your smart contract and then copy paste hash
step1: npx hardhat node
step2: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
